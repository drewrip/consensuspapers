	Verdi is a framework for practically verifying distributed systems. Often implementations of distributed systems are
	too complex to be exhaustively tested, so, Verdi attempts to choose an appropriate fault model to more effectively enumerate bugs and faults.

	\textit{Teaching Rigorous Distributed Systems with Efficient Model Checking} \cite{MichaelWAET2019}

	While exhaustively determining bugs in a distributed system can be incredibly effective, it can, at the same time, be incredibly costly for developers.
	This paper purposes a model that allows students, or developers with fewer resources at their disposal to efficiently verify their systems and visually debug them.
	Also included, are methods to reduce the search space for potential faults in the system and to detect errors in realtime.
